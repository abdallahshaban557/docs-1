<Note> Before continuing, **make sure you've [integrated Decipher](/next.js.integrate)** which ensures your bundled/minified stack traces are enriched with code on production, by uploading sourcemaps. </Note>

## Step 1: Sign in to Decipher

Sign in to [Decipher](https://prod.getdecipher.com) using **your work email address** and a `customerId` will be automatically created for you, which you'll use in the next step.

## Step 2: Initialize Decipher on the backend

You should have already installed the Decipher NextJS SDK when you [integrated Decipher](/next.js.integrate). This is required to continue.

Create a `decipher.config.[ts|js]` at your project root (sibling to app/ or pages/ directory).

```typescript src/decipher.config.ts
import Decipher from "@decipher-sdk/nextjs";

Decipher.init({
  codebaseId: "CODEBASE_NAME_OF_MY_CHOICE",
  customerId: "MY_CUSTOMER_ID_FROM_STEP_1",
});

export default Decipher;
```

## Step 3: Update your API routes

Choose instructions based on your app structure:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="rectangle-terminal" title="App Router" defaultOpen={true}>

    The steps below apply if you're using [Next.js App Router](https://nextjs.org/docs/app).

    Import `Decipher` into your route files and wrap your handlers using `Decipher.withDecipher` as below.
    ```typescript src/app/api/example/route.ts

import type { NextRequest, NextResponse } from "next/server";
import Decipher from "@/decipher.config";

async function handler(req: NextRequest) {
       const body = await req.json();
       return NextResponse.json({ message: 'Processed successfully' },
       { status: 200 });
}

export const POST = Decipher.withDecipher(handler);
```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="rectangle-terminal" title="Pages Router">
        The steps below apply if you're using [Next.js Pages Router](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages).

    Import `Decipher` into your route files and wrap your handlers using `Decipher.withDecipherPage` as below.
    ```typescript src/pages/api/example/route.ts

import type { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from "next";
import { Decipher } from "@/decipher.config"

const handler = (req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse) => {
       res.status(200).json({ name: "Jane Smith" });
};

export default Decipher.withDecipherPage(handler);
```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

If you use tRPC, you'll need need to follow the [Supporting tRPC](/next.js.supporting-trpc) guide.

That's it! Decipher will now monitor and surface all your errors and exceptions on [the dashboard](https://www.prod.getdecipher.com).

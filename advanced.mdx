# Disabling collection of Request Data
By default, Decipher collects Request bodies to enhance debugability. This can be disabled by updating the setup initialization:

## For TypeScript/JavaScript
Set the `exclude_request_body` boolean when [initializing Decipher](/introduction) as below.
```typescript
{
    // A codebase name of your choice to identify errors in Decipher.
    codebase_id: "CODEBASE_NAME_OF_MY_CHOICE",
    customer_id: "MY_CUSTOMER_ID",
    exclude_request_body: true
}
```
Decipher will no longer collect any request bodies.

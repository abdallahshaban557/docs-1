# Disabling collection of Request Data
By default, Decipher collects Request bodies to enhance debugability. This can be disabled by updating the setup initialization:

## For TypeScript/JavaScript
Set the `excludeRequestBody` boolean when [initializing Decipher](/intro) as below.
```typescript
{
    // A codebase name of your choice to identify errors in Decipher.
    codebaseId: "CODEBASE_NAME_OF_MY_CHOICE",
    customerId: "MY_CUSTOMER_ID",
    excludeRequestBody: true
}
```
Decipher will no longer collect any request bodies.

# Disabling local / non-production errors
By default, Decipher shows and alerts on all errors, including local ones. This can be changed by updating the setup initialization.

## For TypeScript/JavaScript
Set the config field `environment` to **anything other than** `"production"` for environments in which errors that should not be shown/alerted on, when [initializing Decipher](/intro) as below.

This config field defaults to `"production"` if not explicitly set.
```typescript
{
    // A codebase name of your choice to identify errors in Decipher.
    codebaseId: "CODEBASE_NAME_OF_MY_CHOICE",
    customerId: "MY_CUSTOMER_ID",
    environment: "dev" // or process.env.MY_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE
}
```
Decipher will no longer show or alert on non-production errors.

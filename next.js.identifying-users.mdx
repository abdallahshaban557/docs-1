## Add user information as context for your errors

If you want to add user details to errors make sure to call `Decipher.setUser()` near the beginning of the request. 

You can include any subset of the following: `id`, `email`, `username`

```typescript route.ts
// ...other imports
import Decipher from "@/decipher.config";

async function handler(req: NextRequest) {
  // ...

  Decipher.setUser({ email: "test@test.com" });

  try {
    thisFunctionMightThrowErrors();
  } catch (error) { 
  
  // ...

}
```

title: "Adding Sourcemaps"
description: "You can upload your Sourcemaps to Decipher to enable seeing production JavaScript/TypeScript stack traces with the appropriate source code."

<Warning>
  IMPORTANT: If you are using Next.js, Decipher will automatically upload
  Sourcemaps; you don't need these instructions. See the corresponding section
  of the [Next.js](next.js#step-3-add-your-sourcemaps-important) docs.
</Warning>

## Step 1: Update your `tsconfig.json` to generate sourcemaps.

If you haven't already, add the following two options (`sourceMap` and `inlineSources`) to `compilerOptions`:

```json
{
    "compilerOptions": {
        "sourceMap": true,
        "inlineSources": true,
        ...
    },
    ...
}
```

## Step 2: Install the Sourcemap Uploader

```shell Terminal
npm install -D @decipher-sdk/sourcemap-uploader
```

## Step 3: Run the Sourcemap Uploader

Run the uploader with the path to your sourcemaps, using your API key found under [Settings](https://prod.getdecipher.com/settings).

```shell Terminal
npx @decipher-sdk/sourcemap-uploader -k <YOUR_DECIPHER_API_KEY> -p <PATH_TO_SOURCEMAPS>
```

An **example invocation** of the uploader looks like this (run from root of project):

```shell Terminal
npx @decipher-sdk/sourcemap-uploader -k decipher_eyJhbGciOiJ -p app/src/.next/server/
```

That's it! Decipher will now include source code in your error stack traces.

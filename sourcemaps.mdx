description: "You can upload your Sourcemaps to Decipher to enable seeing production JavaScript/TypeScript stack traces with the appropriate source code."
---

## Step 1:  Install the Sourcemap Uploader

```shell Terminal
npm install @decipher-sdk/sourcemap-uploader
```

## Step 2: Run the Sourcemap Uploader

Run the uploader with the path to your sourcemaps, using your API key found under [Settings](https://prod.getdecipher.com/settings).

```shell Terminal
npx @decipher-sdk/sourcemap-uploader -k <YOUR_DECIPHER_API_KEY> <PATH_TO_SOURCEMAPS>
```

An example invocation fo the uploader looks like this (run from root of project):
```shell Terminal
npx @decipher-sdk/sourcemap-uploader -k decipher_eyJhbGciOiJ .
```

That's it! Decipher will now include source code in your error stack traces.

## Report caught errors to Decipher

If you want to capture error's with handled exceptions (e.g. in a `try`/`catch` block) you can use `Decipher.captureError(error)`:

```typescript route.ts
import type { NextRequest, NextResponse } from "next";
import Decipher from "@/decipher.config";

async function handler(req: NextRequest) {
  // ...
  try {
    thisFunctionMightThrowErrors();
  } catch (error) {
    Decipher.captureError(error);
    return NextResponse.json(
      { message: "An error occurred." },
      { status: 500 }
    );
  }
  // ...
  return NextResponse.json(
    { message: "Processed successfully" },
    { status: 200 }
  );
}

export const POST = Decipher.withDecipher(handler);
```

That's it! Decipher will now capture caught errors.

## Step 1: Sign in to Decipher

Sign in to [Decipher](https://prod.getdecipher.com) using **your work email address** and a `customerId` will be automatically created for you, which you'll use in the next step.

## Step 2: Integrate the SDK

### Install the SDK

```shell Terminal
npm install @decipher-sdk/frontend
```

### Add the `WithDecipher` component to your app.

Simply import `WithDecipher` and declare it anywhere in your app, ideally at the top-level.

```typescript layout.tsx
import WithDecipher from "@decipher-sdk/frontend";

export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: Readonly<{
  children: React.ReactNode;
}>) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>
        <WithDecipher
          customerId="YOUR_CUSTOMER_ID_FROM_STEP_1"
          codebaseId="CODEBASE_NAME_OF_YOUR_CHOICE"
          // User prop and all its fields are optional.
          // This represents your current viewing user so that sessions are tagged accordingly.
          user={{
            id: "some_optional_user_id",
            email: "some_optional_user_email",
            username: "some_optional_username",
          }}
        />
        {children}
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

## Step 3 [IMPORTANT]: Add your sourcemaps
<Warning>
  IMPORTANT: If you are using Next.js for your frontend, Decipher can
  automatically upload Sourcemaps; you don't need these instructions. Instead, see the
  corresponding section of the
  [Next.js](next.js#step-3-add-your-sourcemaps-important) docs.
</Warning>
When your code runs on production, it is likely minified and/or bundled, so we need
to upload sourcemaps to see stack traces with the right code.

Follow the [Uploading Sourcemaps](/sourcemaps) instructions to get unminified stack traces in your errors.

That's it! Decipher will now automatically capture sessions with errors, alongside useful runtime data for debugging, and surface them on the [Dashboard](https://prod.getdecipher.com/).
These sessions will be analyzed for user impact analysis and priority.

## Setting up frontend SDK and sourcemas

Update your `next.config.[m]js` as below to make sure your sourcemaps are added to Decipher.
```typescript next.config.mjs
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
import { withDecipherConfig } from "@decipher-sdk/nextjs";

const nextConfig = {
  // ...your existing NextConfig
};

export default withDecipherConfig(nextConfig, {
  apiKey: "YOUR_DECIPHER_API_KEY", // From the /settings page.
  frontendCodebaseId: "YOUR_FRONTEND_CODEBASE_NAME", // you pick this one
  customerId: "YOUR_CUSTOMER_ID", // from /settings page
});
```

Decipher will now automatically capture frontend errors and session replays, as well as upload production sourcemaps upon new releases of your app and include source code in your error stack traces.

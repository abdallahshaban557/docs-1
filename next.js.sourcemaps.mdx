## Add your sourcemaps

When your code runs on production, it is likely minified and/or bundled, so we need to upload sourcemaps to see stack traces with the right code.

Update your `next.config.[m]js` as below to make sure your sourcemaps are added to Decipher.
```typescript next.config.mjs
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
import { withDecipherConfig } from "@decipher-sdk/nextjs";

const nextConfig = {
  // ...your existing NextConfig
};

export default withDecipherConfig(nextConfig, {
  apiKey: "YOUR_DECIPHER_API_KEY", // From the /settings page.
});
```
Decipher will now automatically upload production sourcemaps upon new releases of your app and include source code in your error stack traces.

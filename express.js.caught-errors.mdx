## Report caught errors to Decipher

If you want to capture error details like the stack trace for handled exceptions (e.g. in a `try`/`catch` block) you can use `Decipher.captureError(error)`:

```typescript app.ts
// ...other imports
const Decipher = require('@decipher-sdk/express');

app.get('/order', function (req, res) {
    try {
      thisFunctionMightThrowErrors()
    } catch (error) {
      Decipher.captureError(error)
      res.status(500).send('An error occurred');
    }
});
```

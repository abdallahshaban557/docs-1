## Setting up the SDK

Update your `next.config.[m]js` as below to make sure your sourcemaps are added to Decipher.
```typescript next.config.mjs
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
import { withDecipherConfig } from "@decipher-sdk/nextjs";

const nextConfig = {
  // ...your existing NextConfig
};

export default withDecipherConfig(nextConfig, {
  apiKey: "YOUR_DECIPHER_API_KEY", // From the /settings page.
  customerId: "YOUR_CUSTOMER_ID", // From the /settings page.
  frontendCodebaseId: "YOUR_FRONTEND_CODEBASE_NAME", // You pick this name to group your frontend errors.
});
```

Decipher will now automatically capture frontend errors and session replays, as well as upload production sourcemaps upon new releases of your app and include source code in your error stack traces.

<Note>Note that Decipher automatically creates a `decipher.client.config.ts` file at the root of your repository with the values you add here. Do not modify that file; make changes here only.</Note>

## Test the integration!
Download this [example page.jsx file](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1EmANF9NgfnwOO2oHor8cL-JE7-jBn_Io?usp=drive_link) which will force an error to confirm that everything is setup as expected.

Put it under app/decipher-example/page.jsx and then load up localhost:XXXX/decipher-example

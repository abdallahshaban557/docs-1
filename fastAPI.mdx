## Step 1: Sign in to Decipher

Sign in to [Decipher](https://prod.getdecipher.com) using **your work email address** and a `customer_id` will be automatically created for you, which you'll use in the next step.

## Step 2: Integrate the SDK

### Install the SDK

```shell Terminal
pip install decipher-sdk-fastapi
```

### Instrumenting your FastAPI app

Simply import `decipher_sdk` and initialize it as below.

```python app.py
from fastapi import FastAPI, Request
import decipher_sdk

app = FastAPI()

decipher_sdk.init(
    app,
    # A codebase name of your choice to identify errors in Decipher.
    codebase_id="CODEBASE_NAME_OF_MY_CHOICE",
    # This comes from https://www.prod.getdecipher.com/settings; see Step 1.
    customer_id="MY_CUSTOMER_ID_FROM_STEP_1"
)

@app.route("/submit", methods=['POST'])
def submit_data():
    data = request.json
    return jsonify({"status": "success", "received_data": data})

```

That's it! Decipher will now monitor and surface all your errors and exceptions on [the dashboard](https://www.prod.getdecipher.com).

### Capturing error details on handled exceptions

If you want to capture error details like the stack trace for handled exceptions (e.g. in a try/catch) you can use `Decipher.captureError(error)` like below:

```typescript app.ts
// ...other imports
import decipher_sdk

@app.get("/gonnaBeAnError")
async def create_error(request: Request):
    try:
        # Simulate an error
        raise ValueError("This is a test error")
    except Exception as e:
        # Manually capture the error
        decipher_sdk.capture_error(e)
        return {"error": "An error occurred"}

```

Boom! Decipher will now include the stack trace and other context to help you and Decipher's AI debug.

## Find the alerts page

Go to the [Alerts](https://prod.getdecipher.com/alerts) and make sure to login using **your work email address**.

## Slack Alerts
Hit the "Enable Slack Alerts" and authorize Decipher to send alerts to a chosen Slack channel.

That's it! Decipher will now send alerts to this channel.

## Email Alerts
You can turn on email alerts by clicking the toggle.

Email alerts will be sent to all team members.

## Alert Rules
You can choose between "New Errors Only" and "Every Error Instance"

*New Errors Only:* Notifies only on errors that the application hasn't seen (or alerted on) before.
*Every Error Istance:* Notifies all errors including those that have been seen before.

An error is considered "new" when the codebase_id/error_message/endpoint combination is new.

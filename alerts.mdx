> Please make sure [you've set Decipher up](/introduction#framework-docs) in your application before continuing.

## Step 1: Sign in to Decipher.

Sign in to [Decipher](https://prod.getdecipher.com/settings) using **your work email address**.

## Step 2: Hit the "Enable Slack Alerts" and authorize Decipher to send alerts to a chosen Slack channel.

That's it! Decipher will now send alerts to this channel.

## What does Decipher alert on?
Currently, Decipher alerts when there is a NEW error. That is, an error that the application hasn't seen (or alerted on) before.

An error is considered "new" when the codebase_id/error_message/endpoint combination is new.

We are working on enabling more customizability to alerts.

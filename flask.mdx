## Step 1: Sign in to Decipher

Sign in to [Decipher](https://prod.getdecipher.com) using **your work email address** and a `customer_id` will be automatically created for you, which you'll use in the next step.

## Step 2: Integrate the SDK

### Install the SDK

```shell Terminal
pip install decipher-sdk
```

### Instrumenting your Flask app

Simply import `decipher_sdk` and initialize it as below.

```python app.py
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import decipher_sdk

app = Flask(__name__)

decipher_sdk.init(
    # A codebase name of your choice to identify errors in Decipher.
    codebase_id="CODEBASE_NAME_OF_MY_CHOICE",
    # This comes from https://www.prod.getdecipher.com/settings; see Step 1.
    customer_id="MY_CUSTOMER_ID_FROM_STEP_1"
)

@app.route("/submit", methods=['POST'])
def submit_data():
    data = request.json
    return jsonify({"status": "success", "received_data": data})

```
That's it! Decipher will now monitor and surface all your errors and exceptions on [the dashboard](https://www.prod.getdecipher.com).

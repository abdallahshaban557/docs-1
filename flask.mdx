<Note> **⏱ Estimated Time To Completion: 3 minutes**</Note>

## Step 1: Sign in to Decipher

Sign in to [Decipher](https://prod.getdecipher.com) using **your work email address** and a `customer_id` will be automatically created for you, which you'll use in the next step.

## Step 2: Integrate the SDK

### Install the SDK

```shell Terminal
pip install decipher-sdk
```

### Instrumenting your Flask app

Simply import `decipher_sdk` and initialize it as below.

```python app.py
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import decipher_sdk

app = Flask(__name__)

decipher_sdk.init(
    # A codebase name of your choice to identify errors in Decipher.
    codebase_id="CODEBASE_NAME_OF_MY_CHOICE",
    # This comes from https://www.prod.getdecipher.com/settings; see Step 1.
    customer_id="MY_CUSTOMER_ID_FROM_STEP_1"
)

@app.route("/submit", methods=['POST'])
def submit_data():
    data = request.json
    return jsonify({"status": "success", "received_data": data})

```
That's it! Decipher will now monitor and surface all your errors and exceptions on [the dashboard](https://www.prod.getdecipher.com).


### Capturing error details on handled exceptions

If you want to capture error details like the stack trace for handled exceptions (e.g. in a try/catch) you can use `Decipher.capture_error(error)` like below:

```python app.py
// ...other imports
import decipher_sdk

@app.route('/handled_example', methods=['GET'])
def example_endpoint():
    try:
        raise ValueError("This is a handled error")
    except Exception as e:
        decipher_sdk.capture_error(e)
    return jsonify({"status": "success"}), 200

```

Boom! Decipher will now include the stack trace and other context to help you and Decipher's AI debug.

### Add user information as context for your errors

If you want to add user details to errors make sure to call `decipher_sdk.set_user()` near the beginning of the request. 

You can include any subset of the following: `id`, `email`, `username`

```python app.py
// ...other imports
import decipher_sdk

@app.route('/handled_example', methods=['GET'])
def example_endpoint():
    decipher_sdk.set_user({"id": "2958292", "email": "john@example.com", "username:": "John Smith"})
    // other code here
    return jsonify({"status": "success"}), 200

```

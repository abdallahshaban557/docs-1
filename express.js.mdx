## Step 1: Sign in to Decipher

Sign in to [Decipher](https://prod.getdecipher.com) using **your work email address** and a `customer_id` will be automatically created for you, which you'll use in the next step.

## Step 2: Integrate the SDK

### Install the SDK

```shell Terminal
npm install @decipher-sdk/express@latest
```

### Instrumenting your Express app

Import `Decipher`, initialize it, and call `app.use` on it as below.

> **IMPORTANT:** You must add `Decipher.Handlers.requestHandler()` **before** any other middleware and `Decipher.Handlers.errorHandler` **immediately after** your controllers/endpoints to ensure errors are captured correctly.

```typescript app.ts
// ...other imports
const Decipher = require('@decipher-sdk/express');

const app = express();

// A codebase name of your choice to identify errors in Decipher.
Decipher.init({ codebase_id: "CODEBASE_NAME_OF_MY_CHOICE", customer_id: "MY_CUSTOMER_ID_FROM_STEP_1"})

// IMPORTANT: The Decipher Request Handler must be the first middleware on the app.
app.use(Decipher.Handlers.requestHandler());

// Your controllers
app.get("/", ...)
app.get("/submit", ...)

// IMPORTANT: The Decipher error handler must be immediately after the controllers.
app.use(Decipher.Handlers.errorHandler);
```
That's it! Decipher will now monitor and surface all your errors and exceptions on [the dashboard](https://www.prod.getdecipher.com).

### Capturing error details on handled exceptions

If you want to capture error details like the stack trace for handled exceptions (e.g. in a try/catch) you can use `Decipher.captureError(error)` like below:

```typescript app.ts
// ...other imports
const Decipher = require('@decipher-sdk/express');

app.get('/order', function (req, res) {
    try {
      thisIsAnUndefinedFunction()
    } catch (error) {
      Decipher.captureError(error)
      res.status(500).send('An error occurred');
    }
});
```

## Step 3 [IMPORTANT]: Add your sourcemaps
When your code runs on production, it is likely minified and/or bundled, so we need to upload sourcemaps to see stack traces with the right code.

Follow the [Uploading Sourcemaps](/sourcemaps) instructions to get unminified stack traces in your errors.

Boom! Decipher will now include the stack trace and other context to help you and Decipher's AI debug.

---

## Step 1: Sign in to Decipher

Sign in to [Decipher](https://prod.getdecipher.com) using **your work email address** and a `customer_id` will be automatically created for you, which you'll use in the next step.

## Step 2: Integrate the SDK

### Install the SDK

```shell Terminal
npm install @decipher-sdk/express@latest
```

### Instrumenting your Express app

Import `DecipherRequestHandler` and `DecipherErrorHandler` and call `app.use` on them as below.

> **IMPORTANT:** You must add `DecipherRequestHandler` **before** any other middleware and `DecipherErrorHandler` **immediately after** your controllers/endpoints to ensure errors are captured correctly.

```typescript app.ts
// ...other imports
import { DecipherRequestHandler, DecipherErrorHandler } from '@decipher-sdk/express';

const app = express();
// IMPORTANT: The DecipherRequestHandler must be the first middleware on the app.
app.use(DecipherRequestHandler({
   // A codebase name of your choice to identify errors in Decipher.
   codebaseId: "CODEBASE_NAME_OF_MY_CHOICE",
   customerId: "MY_CUSTOMER_ID_FROM_STEP_1"
}));

// Your controllers
app.get("/", ...)
app.get("/submit", ...)
// IMPORTANT: The error handler must be immediately after the controllers.
app.use(DecipherErrorHandler)
```
That's it! Decipher will now monitor and surface all your errors and exceptions on [the dashboard](https://www.prod.getdecipher.com).
